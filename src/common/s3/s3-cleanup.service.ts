/**
 * S3CleanupService
 *
 * Removes orphaned S3 objects that were uploaded but never referenced in the database.
 * This handles cases where:
 * 1. A presigned URL was generated but the upload was never completed
 * 2. An upload completed but the DB record was never created (crash/error)
 * 3. Files were uploaded for testing/preview but never finalized
 *
 * The service runs daily and only removes objects older than the configured grace period
 * that have no corresponding DB reference in either:
 * - User.avatarUrl (for avatar uploads)
 * - DisputeEvidence.s3Path (for evidence uploads)
 * - KycDocument.s3Path (for KYC uploads)
